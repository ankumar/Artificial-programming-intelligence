While Levanter's main focus is pretraining, we can also use it for fine-tuning. As an example, we'll show how to reproduce Stanford Alpaca, using Levanter and either Llama 1 or Llama 2 7B. The script we develop will be designed for Alpaca, defaulting to using its dataset and prompts, but it should work for any single-turn instruction-following task.
